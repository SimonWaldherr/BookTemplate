## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `content/`: This directory contains the Markdown files (.qmd or .md) that make up the content of your book or document.
- `.github/workflows/`: This directory contains the GitHub Actions workflow files that automate the build process.
- `_quarto.yml`: The Quarto configuration file that specifies how the Markdown should be converted to LaTeX and then to PDF. It also can generate .docx and .epub files.
