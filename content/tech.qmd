## Overview of Technologies

Before diving into the process, let's briefly overview the key technologies used in this project:

### Quarto

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It allows users to convert documents written in Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter, or Qmd to various formats including HTML, PDF, and EPUB.

### LaTeX

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions enables automation of all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

### GitHub Release

GitHub Releases are a way to ship software to your users. It's a GitHub feature that makes it easy to bundle source code, release notes, and links to binary files for others to use.
